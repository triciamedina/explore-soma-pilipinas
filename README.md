# Explore SOMA Pilipinas
An interactive map of the SOMA Pilipinas cultural district of San Francisco. Users are invited to explore and learn about businesses, community organizations, landmarks, and events that make up this cultural and historical neighborhood.

## Motivation
The current SOMA Pilipinas map is a static PDF. I was inspired to create an interactive version of the map to better represent the neighborhood as a dynamic and living cultural district with ongoing new generations of families and businessowners.
